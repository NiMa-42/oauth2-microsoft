# Microsoft Provider for OAuth 2.0 Client

This package provides Microsoft OAuth 2.0 support for the PHP League's [OAuth 2.0 Client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client).

It is forked from the [official library](https://github.com/stevenmaguire/oauth2-microsoft) created by Steven Maguire.

## Why?
The repository from Steven is no longer receiving additional updates and is still using the old endpoints.

## What?

This fork updates the following attributes:

- use v2 scope system instead of the live connect scope system
- update endpoint url's 

## Usage

If you wish to use the Microsoft Oauth in your Symfony application, you can follow these steps.
